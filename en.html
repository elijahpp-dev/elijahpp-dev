        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>The Good Coin is a community-powered cryptocurrency to build farms (tilapia ponds, free-range chickens, rice fields) to feed the poor. 50% of production is donated, 50% sold affordably. With your contribution, we’ll break ground and provide transparent updates.</p>
        <h3>Our Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a tilapia fish farm producing hundreds of thousands of pounds of food yearly.</li>
            <li>Launch a free-range chicken operation for eggs and poultry, donating half.</li>
            <li>Begin rice farming, donating half the harvest.</li>
            <li>Document progress with photos, videos, and open records.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sustainability & Community Impact</h3>
        <p>Fish parts feed chickens, pond water fertilizes rice, and the cycle supports more food. Workers are paid fairly, and the local community benefits most, with plans to scale globally.</h3>
        <h3>Community & Future Plans</h3>
        <p>Holders can vote on future projects and locations (next: Ecuador, then Dominican Republic, and the U.S.).</p>
        <h3>Transparency & Oversight</h3>
        <p>AI tracks funds, production, and distributions. Videos and reports will be public.</p>
        <h3>Whitelist Confirmation</h3>
