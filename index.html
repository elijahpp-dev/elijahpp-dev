        <h2>Welcome to The Good Coin</h2>
        <p>The Good Coin is more than a cryptocurrency ‚Äî it‚Äôs a movement powered by love and you. Join us in making a difference!</p>
        <p>üåç The Good Coin ‚Äî Mission Statement</p>
        <p>The Good Coin is more than a cryptocurrency ‚Äî it‚Äôs a movement powered by love and you. Our mission is to feed the poor, create sustainable farms, and reward those who help. We are launching fish and chicken farms that will donate half of all production to families in need, while the other half will be sold to support operations and repay contributors. Our first farm is launching in the Philippines, with plans to expand globally ‚Äî next stop: Ecuador.</p>
        <p>We believe money is just a tool ‚Äî real value comes from what it builds. That‚Äôs why your investment will not sit in a vault or speculative fund ‚Äî it will go straight to buying land, building ponds, raising fish and chickens, and giving food to those who need it most. Every egg and every fish counts.</p>
        <p>The money you invest will be backed by land and fish or farms to help feed people. This is what your investment will be for ‚Äî to help feed the poor and for you to make money. All money invested will be for the acquisition of land so we can produce food. Your coin or your money is backed by this land ‚Äî remember this is a one-year investment. You can trade the coin, or you can hold it. We believe the price will increase dramatically since there are people who want to do good. And the more support we receive, the better investments we can make ‚Äî creating an even better return for you.</p>
